Aim
To create a cross-platform React Native App to display a list of currency conversion rates of USD to various other currencies.

Instructions
Use Expo to set up a new project.
Use https://www.floatrates.com/daily/usd.json to fetch the currency conversion rates.
Use Zustand along with async-storage for persistent data storage.
Use Axios for HTTP requests (optional) 

Must haves
The app should consist of a single screen with a list of all the conversion rates.
Each list item should display the following information at minimum:
Country name
Currency name
Conversion rate
Last update date and time
The currency conversion rates data should be fetched at a regular interval (eg: 10s) and stored in a persistent zustand store.
The list should then use the same store for the data and render all the list elements.
